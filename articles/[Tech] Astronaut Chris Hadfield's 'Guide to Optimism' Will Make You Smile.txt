Astronaut Chris Hadfield, the guy who literally rocked out in space, is spreading an optimistic message just in time for the start of 2015.

The Canadian astronaut -- famous for his fantastic mustache and killer rendition of David Bowie's "Space Oddity" -- presented his New Year's gift to the world, "An Astronaut's Guide to Optimism," which was posted to YouTube.

"In 100 years, we've gone from filming the Wright brothers, to landing a camera on Titan, a moon 800 million miles away," Hadfield says.

"There are problems with everything and nothing is yet perfect, but that shouldn't be cause to bemoan. That should be cause to achieve," he said. "Our world is a better place than we often claim it to be."

Hadfield shares a number of reasons to be optimistic, pointing to advancements in health, wellness, longevity and literacy.

"When thinking if you're going to be optimistic this year, remember, nobody changes the world on their own," Hadfield says. "It all starts with a resolution. What's yours?"
