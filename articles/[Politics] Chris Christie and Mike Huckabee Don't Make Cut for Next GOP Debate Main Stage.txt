The lineup for the next GOP debate has been announced and Chris Christie and Mike Huckabee didn't make the cut for the main event, according to Fox Business.

Participation in the Nov. 10 debate was based on 4 recent polls: the candidates needed to average 2.5 percent or higher to be featured in the main debate, and 1 percent or higher to be in the undercard debate.

The eight who made the cut for the main stage are Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Jeb Bush, Carly Fiorina, John Kasich and Rand Paul.

The candidates in the undercard are Christie and Huckabee as well as Jindal and Santorum, who have been in previous undercard debates.

Those who didnâ€™t make the cut for either are Sen. Lindsey Graham, George Pataki and Jim Gilmore.

Christie and Huckabee were close to making it into the main event with both averaged 2.25 percent in the polls.

Pataki and Graham were cut from the undercard debate, so they will not participate in either debate Tuesday. Gilmore has not qualified for any debates.

This is also the first time there will only eight participants in the main stage debate. The last GOP debate had 10 main stage participants.

The debates will air (and stream online) this Tuesday Nov. 10 at 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. ET on Fox Business.
